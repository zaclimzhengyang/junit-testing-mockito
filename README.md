# junit-testing-mockito

this project serves as a junit testing for a simple Employee source code.
in here, we do testing using 
1. junit assert to test individual unit of pure function methods 
2. mockito to mock lower level functions in order to test the higher level functions.
3. spy annotation to do a partial mock
